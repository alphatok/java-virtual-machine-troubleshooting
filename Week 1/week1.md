## Hotspot JVM Memory Management

Memory is managed automatically in the HotSpot JVM. The Garbage Collectors in the JVM manage memory freeing the Java programmers from worrying about the object de-allocations. In order to troubleshoot memory related problems, it is important to first understand how memory management works.

This lesson will discuss the process of automatic memory management, and by using simple examples will explain how memory is managed in the HotSpot JVM. We will also talk about the concept of generational garbage collection, and explore the different memory spaces and garbage collectors implemented in the HotSpot JVM. Towards the end of this lesson we will go though the garbage collectors related changes that have been made between different Java versions.
